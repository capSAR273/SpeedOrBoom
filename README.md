This is my first mod for The Long Drive, if you've ever seen the movie Speed this mod is basically that. Once your car reaches 60 km/h, if the bomb is active once you slow down under that amount your car will  explode. You might survive, I tried to tweak the explosion to not kill the player 100% of the time but it is possible.

To activate the bomb:
- Get in your car and hit P. As long as your car isn't moving it will activate the bomb (shown by the green square at the left side of the screen)

The square will show blue if you've passed the 60 km/h mark, so don't slow down or you go Boom.
The square will show red if the bomb is inactive, you can safely drive your car if the square is red.


DISCLAIMER: This mod isn't intended for a long playthrough, as you will inevitably piss in the car at some point and you might activate the bomb. Once it is active there is no way to disable it (currently).
Best of luck out there!
